About this Project

This is an Android application made for use in the Introduction to Software Engineering course at the University of Alberta, it can be run on Android emulators and any compatible Android device.

How to use:

  * Selecting pages *
In order to view a page the tabs across the top can be used to jump to a specific page, otherwise the swipe feature is implemented to switch to the next or previous page.

  * To Do *
Upon boot up the user will be presented with a To Do screen. From this screen the user can use the text field in combination with the "Add to List" button to populate a to do list on the same screen. The items in the to do list can be checked or unchecked to represent completion, this can be done with a long click on the selected item. Additionally, multiple items can be selected on a short click and these items can be deleted or moved to the archive.

  * Archive *
This page maintains the overall functionality from the To Do page, items can be checked, unchecked and selected. Selected items can be deleted or sent back to the To Do page via the "Unarchive" button.

  * Email  *
This allows the user to send an email of several selected items. A single address can be specified in the text field, or the user can skip this and choose recipients via the email client that is loaded.

  * History *
This page represents a simple history of all the items in the app. It displays the total number of to do items, including which of those items which are complete or incomplete. The same is done with the archived information.
